# R environment

First recorded 2026-08-13, when `renv` was removed from this repository, and
re-recorded 2026-09-25 after a full rebuild of the Chapter 3 caches and all
exhibits. Package provenance now lives here rather than in a lockfile.

## What produced the current results

- **R 4.5.3**
- Packages installed from the dated Posit P3M snapshot
  **`https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/__linux__/noble/2026-07-15`**, plus
  `pcaMethods` from Bioconductor.
- Packages resolve from the R installation's default library paths. There is no
  project-local library.

`pcaMethods` is not on P3M/CRAN; install it from Bioconductor:

```r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("pcaMethods")
```

The snapshot date is the pin: it fixes package versions the way a lockfile
would, and it also covers the system libraries a lockfile cannot (the
`systemfonts` build needs `libfontconfig-dev`, `libjpeg-dev`, and
`libtiff-dev`). In this project's sandbox both are set in
`.devcontainer/Dockerfile` (`ARG R_VERSION`, `ARG CRAN_SNAPSHOT`) and installed
by `.devcontainer/install-packages.sh`.

## Versions in use

## Why some versions matter

Reported standard errors and test statistics depend on package versions, not
just on the code. `fixest` drives the clustered SEs in the MP-style regression
tables, and `strucchange` drives the structural break tests. Record the version
alongside any results that get published.

## History

The repository used `renv` until 2026-08-13. The lockfile that remains in git
history, deleted in `67fcac8`, records **R 4.5.1 and 175 packages** and is
**not** the environment that produced current results; it was already stale when
it was removed. An updated snapshot taken on 2026-08-13, recording R 4.5.3,
Bioconductor 3.22, and 187 packages, was never committed and is lost. This file
supersedes both.

The 2026-08-13 list (data.table 1.17.8, ggplot2 3.5.2, xtable 1.8.4, and so on)
came from an older package library, not from the 2026-07-15 snapshot it named.
Installing from that snapshot gives the versions above. The move to data.table
1.18 changed `frollapply()`: an all-`NA` window result now keeps the logical
type of `fill = NA`, which silently turned the Table 1 t-statistics into `TRUE`
until `3b_DataMiningSummary.R` and `3d_DMCorrelationsPCA.R` switched to
`fill = NA_real_`. After that fix, the rebuilt tables match the August ones.
